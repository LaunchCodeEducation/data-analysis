Working With Objects
====================

Once created, objects are *mutable*. We can change the values of properties or
add new ones as needed.

.. _object-properties:

Object Properties
-----------------

When using objects, we often want to access the value of a property, change a
property value, or add a completely new property. To do this, we need the
object's name and the property name.

To modify object properties, we use *dot notation*:

.. sourcecode:: python

   object_name.property_name  # Access & return a property value from object_name.

   object_name.property_name = new_value  # Change the value of an existing property.

   object_name.new_property = value   # Add a new property and value to the object.

Note that ``property_name`` and ``new_property`` do NOT end with a set of
parentheses ``()``.

.. admonition:: Try It!

   In the program below, ``dog`` is an object with two properties---``name``
   and ``age``. Follow the instructions below the editor to practice using dot
   notation with an object.

   #. Run the program as-is to see how the dot notation on lines 8 and 10
      accesses and *returns* the property values.
   #. On line 13, use dot notation to change the value of the ``name``
      property to ``'Fleas'``.
   #. On line 14, use the ``+=`` operator to increase the age of ``dog`` by 3
      years.
   #. Run the program again. Properly done, the output should look like:

      ::

         Spot
         3
         Fleas 6

   #. Uncomment line 19 and run the program. You should see an error message
      because ``dog`` does not contain a property called ``breed``.
   #. On the line 17, use dot notation to create a new property called
      ``breed`` and assign it a string value.
   #. On line 18, add the ``is_cute`` property to ``dog``. Assign it a boolean
      value instead of a string.
   #. Run the program again. Properly done, the output should look similar to:

      ::

         Spot
         3
         Fleas 6
         mutt True

.. admonition:: Tip

   Object properties work like the :ref:`key/value pairs <key-value-pair>` in a
   dictionary. Each property name acts as a label that points to a specific
   piece of data (the value).

Calling Methods
---------------

When we learned about strings, lists, and dictionaries, we practiced calling
methods on each type of object. The same syntax applies for all other objects
as well:

.. sourcecode:: python

   object_name.method_name(arguments)

Note that some methods require *arguments* (data) inside the parentheses, while
other methods do not.

.. sourcecode:: python

   my_list.append(100)  # 100 is the argument for the list method .append()

   my_string.lower() # The string method .lower() requires no arguments

Methods vs. Functions
---------------------

Back in the functions chapter, we learned that these defined blocks of code
behave like a :ref:`machine <function-machine>` when called. A function takes a
set of input, performs an action with it, and in some cases returns an output.

Methods are also defined blocks of code that perform actions. Just like
functions, we can call methods over and over again, send them input, and
collect an output. So what's the difference between *methods* and *functions*?

Functionally (pun intended), the two are the same thing. However, we should
consider a method as a special type of function, one with some extra
restrictions and advantages.

Call Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^

The first difference involves the syntax for calling functions vs. methods.

::

   function_name(arguments)

   object_name.method_name(arguments)

As programmers, we call functions and send them all the data they need. If we
leave out a value, our program will likely crash.

On the other hand, when we use an object to call a method, the object can
supply some or all of the required data.

Methods are Object Specific
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can call a function anywhere we want in our program, and it will often work
with different data types. For example, ``len()`` operates equally well on the
``string``, ``list``, and ``dict`` data types. The ``max()`` function operates
on lists, strings, and a set of numbers separated by commas.

Methods are defined to work with one specific type of object. We cannot call a
method on objects of a different type.

Try It!
^^^^^^^

In this example, the ``dog`` object includes three methods called ``speak``,
``fetch``, and ``increase_age``.

#. On line 9, add a statement to call the ``speak`` method, then run the
   program. The method requires no argument, but including an integer
   changes the output. Try it!
#. The ``speak`` method prints to the console, but the ``fetch`` method
   does not. On line 12, print the value *returned* by ``fetch``.
#. Try adding a string argument when you call the ``fetch`` method.
#. On line 15, print the ``age`` property for ``dog``.
#. On line 16, call the ``increase_age`` method, which requires an integer
   as an argument. Print the ``age`` property again to check the result.
