Project: Classes and Objects
============================

Now its time to design a new class of robots. These objects will all be able to
clean our school building, but we want to pick the best ones.

Let's create a class to handle new cleaning crew candidates!

Before You Start
----------------

If your teacher added you to a :ref:`Trinket course <trinket-course-assignments>`, login to your
account to access the starter code for this project.

Otherwise, use the links below to copy the starter code.

#. `Trinket code <https://trinket.io/python/7b69aa933c>`__ (*Remix* before
   getting started).
#. `Repl.it code <https://repl.it/@launchcode/LCHS-Classes-Project-starter-code>`__
   (*Fork* before getting started).

Part 1: Add Class Properties and ``__str__`` Method
---------------------------------------------------

#. Declare a class called ``CrewCandidate`` with an ``__init__`` that takes
   three parameters: ``name``, ``mass``, and ``scores``. Note that ``scores``
   will be a list of test results for the candidate's speed and accuracy.
#. In ``main()``, create objects for the following candidates:

   a. iClean has a mass of 13.5 kg and test scores of 88, 85, and 90.
   b. Shiny has a mass of 1.5 kg and test scores of 93, 88, and 97.
   c. DustVac has a mass of 22.5 kg and test scores of 75, 78, and 62.

#. Define a ``__str__`` method to display the properties of each candidate. The
   output should look something like:

   ::

      **Candidate Information**
      Name: Shiny
      Mass: 1.5 kg
      Scores: [93, 88, 97]

#. Print each object to check to see if your class correctly assigns and
   displays the property values. (You can remove or comment out the ``print``
   statement after your tests pass).

Part 2: Add Another Class Method
--------------------------------

As our candidates complete more tests, we need to be able to add the new
scores to their records.

#. Create an ``add_score`` method in ``CrewCandidate``. The function must take
   a new score as a parameter in addition to ``self``.
#. When passed a score, the function adds the value to ``self.scores`` with the
   :ref:`append method <list-append-examples>`.

   .. admonition:: Tip

      Inside the class, the name of the list is ``self.scores`` instead of
      ``scores``. Thus, ``self.scores.append()`` is the proper syntax.

#. In ``main()``, test your new method by adding a score of ``83`` to iClean's
   record. Print out the new score list with ``object_name.scores``.

Part 3: Add More Methods
------------------------

Now that we can add scores to our candidates' records, we need to evaluate
their fitness for our cleaning program. Let's add two more methods to
``CrewCandidate``. One will average the test scores, and the other will decide
if the candidate should be added to the cleaning team.

Calculating the Test Average
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Define an ``average()`` method. It only needs the ``self`` parameter.
#. To find the average, add up the entries from ``self.scores``, then divide
   the sum by the number of scores in the list.
#. To make the average easier to look at,
   :ref:`round it to 1 decimal place <round-function>`, then return the result
   from the method.

Check your code by evaluating and printing Shiny's average test score
(``92.7``).

Determining Candidate Status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Candidates with averages at or above 90% are automatically added to our new
cleaning crew. Backup robots average between 80 - 89%, while robots with
averages between 70 - 79% get sent out for repairs. Averages below 70% lead to
a short trip to the recycling bin.

#. Add a ``status()`` method to ``CrewCandidate``. The method returns a string
   (``'Accepted'``, ``'Backup'``, ``'Maintenance'``, or ``'Scrapped'``)
   depending on a candidate's average.
#. The ``status`` method requires the average test score. Fortunately, methods
   can call other methods inside a class! Just remember to use
   ``self.method_name()``.
#. Once ``status`` has a candidate's average score, return the proper string
   based on that value.
#. In ``main()``, test the ``status`` method on each of the three candidates.
   Print the result with the format, ``'___ scored an average of ___% (___).'``

   ::

      iClean scored an average of 87.7% (Backup).
      Shiny scored an average of 92.7% (Accepted).
      DustVac scored an average of 71.7% (Maintenance).

Part 4: Play a Bit
------------------

Use the class methods to boost DustVac's status to ``Backup`` or higher. How
many good tests will it take to reach ``Backup`` status? How many to reach
``Accepted``?

Note that scores cannot exceed 100%.

.. admonition:: Tip

   Rather than adding one score at a time, could you use a loop?
