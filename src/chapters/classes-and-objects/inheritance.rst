Inheritance and Other Topics
============================

Constructing classes and using them to create objects gives your Python code a
serious power boost. All that remains for this chapter are a couple of optional
topics that your teacher may or may not ask you to explore. The content can be
found in the ``Optional Content`` appendix:

#. :ref:`Inheritance <class-inheritance>`
#. :ref:`Making independent object copies <deep-copy>`

Consult your teacher about whether or not you should dive into these ideas. The
answer will depend on how close your class is to the end of the semester as
well as the overall goals and objectives of the course.
