``while`` Loops
===============

.. index:: ! while

.. index::
   single: loop; while

There is another Python keyword that can also be used for iteration---``while``.
Unlike a ``for`` loop, which defines a loop variable and a specific starting
and ending point, a **while loop** uses a single condition to determine whether
or not to continue running.

This condition (a :ref:`boolean expression <boolean-expression>`) controls the
iteration. The body of a ``while`` loop repeats as long as the expression
evaluates to ``True``.

``while`` Loop Syntax
---------------------

The general syntax of a ``while`` loop looks like this:

::

   while boolean expression:
      loop body

A ``while`` loop continues to repeat as long as the boolean expression
evaluates to ``True``. This *condition* usually includes a value or variable
that is updated within the loop. Eventually, the condition becomes ``False``,
and the loop stops.

Just like with ``for`` loops, the body of a ``while`` loop must be indented,
and it may contain any number of statements.

.. admonition:: Example

   The following loop repeats until ``total < 1000`` returns ``False``:

   .. sourcecode:: Python
      :linenos:

      total = 0
      increase_by = 14

      while total < 1000:
         total += increase_by
         print(total)

Control Flow
------------

We can visualize the program flow of a ``while`` loop as follows.

.. figure:: figures/while-loop-flow.png
   :alt: Diagram showing the control flow through a while loop.

   Flow of execution of a ``while`` loop

#. Python evaluates the condition, which returns a value of ``True`` or
   ``False``.
#. If the condition is ``False``, exit the ``while`` loop and continue
   the program at the next statement after the loop body.
#. If the condition is ``True``, run the loop body and then go back to step 1.

``for`` Loops Rewritten as ``while`` Loops
------------------------------------------

We can use ``while`` to create any type of loop we want, including anything we
previously did with a ``for`` loop. For example, consider our first ``for``
loop that printed the numbers 0 - 20:

.. sourcecode:: python
   :linenos:

   for num in range(21):
      print(num)

This can be rewritten as a while loop:

.. sourcecode:: python
   :linenos:

   num = 0

   while num < 21:
      print(num)
      num += 1

Instead of using the ``range`` function to produce the values for ``num``, we
need to produce them ourselves in a ``while`` loop. To do this, *before*
starting the loop, we create the variable ``num`` and assign it a value of
``0``. Every iteration, line 5 increases ``num`` by 1. Eventually, ``num``
increases enough to make the condition ``num < 21`` false, and the loop ends.

``num`` plays the same role as the loop variable in the ``for`` loop, but we
need to manage its value ourselves. The ``for`` and ``while`` loops in the
examples above do *exactly* the same thing, but they solve the task slightly
differently.

If we imagine giving instructions to someone, the ``for`` and ``while``
approaches might sound something like:

#. **For**: Repeat this task for each number 0 - 20.
#. **While**: Repeat this task as long as the number is less than 21.

Try It!
^^^^^^^

Let's convert this ``for`` loop into the equivalent ``while``.

.. sourcecode:: python
   :linenos:

   letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
   for_string = ''
   num_letters = 8

   for index in range(num_letters):
      for_string += letters[index]

   print(for_string)  # Displays 'abcdefgh'

Do the following in the editor below:

#. On line 5, define a counter variable called ``index``. Assign it a value of
   ``0``.
#. Next, code the ``while`` statement. Here are two possibilities:

   - ``while index < num_letters:``
   - ``while len(while_string) < num_letters:``

#. Inside the loop, update ``while_string``. Look at line 6 in the ``for`` loop
   for a hint about how to do this.
#. Also inside the loop, increase the value of ``index`` by 1.
#. Run the program to verify that it prints ``abcdefgh`` when
   ``num_letters = 8``.

Input Validation
----------------

``while`` and ``for`` loops serve the same purpose---to repeat a block of code
multiple times. However, ``while`` loops are more flexible than ``for`` loops.
If you don't know how many times the loop needs to run, a ``while`` loop is the
best fit. Letâ€™s look at one example of this.

.. index:: ! input validation
   single: validation; input

.. admonition:: Try It!

   This program is an example of **input validation**, which checks what the
   user enters to make sure it won't cause errors down the line.
   
   In this case, the computer prompts the user to enter a positive number. If
   they enter ``0`` or any negative number, then they see an error message and
   are prompted again within the body of the loop. If the user keeps entering
   invalid numbers, the loop continues to iterate. As soon as the user chooses
   a valid number, the loop ends.

   .. raw:: html

      <iframe height="450px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@launchcode/LCHS-While-Input-Validation?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>

This example shows the additional flexibility provided by ``while`` loops.
``for`` loops iterate a specific number of times, but in this case we have no
way of knowing how many times we need to prompt the user for a number. By
setting a single condition (``num_choice <= 0``) we can keep the ``while`` loop
going until the condition returns ``False``.

Which Loop To Use?
------------------

.. index:: ! definite iteration

Each time we write a ``for`` statement, we tell Python *exactly* how many times
the loop body must repeat. ``for char in "Hello"`` repeats once for each letter
in the string (5 times). Similarly, ``for value in range(10)`` repeats 10
times, with ``value`` assigned the numbers 0 - 9.

Even when we use variables in ``range(start, stop, step)``, these variables
store specific vales. Python knows *exactly* how many times to repeat the loop
body, and this is called **definite iteration**. The starting and ending points
of are set inside the ``for`` statement.

When we write a ``while`` loop, we give Python a condition to evaluate. When
the condition returns ``False``, the loop stops. We do NOT need to know how
many times to repeat the loop. It will keep going as long as necessary.

As we saw in the input validation example, we cannot not know ahead of time how
many tries the user will need. Since a ``for`` loop repeats a specific number
of times, it will not work for this case. Instead, a ``while`` loop works
better. Whether the user needs 1, 2, 10 (or more) tries, the loop operates only
as long as it has to.

.. index:: ! indefinite iteration

**Indefinite iteration** refers to the case where we do not know how many times
a loop needs to repeat.

So which type of loop should we use in our code? ``for`` loops do better when
iterating over a collection or a fixed number of times. ``while`` loops get the
job done when we do not know how long it will take to meet a given condition.

Here are some points of comparison between the two types of loops.

``for`` Pros and Cons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Easier to set up than ``while`` loops.
#. Must have a definite start and end point, and these must be declared in the
   ``for`` statement.
#. Can loop through strings and collections without using an index value (e.g.
   ``for char in 'hello':``).
#. Automatically updates the loop variable.
#. It is hard to accidentally create an infinite Python ``for`` loop.
#. Can be used in place of some ``while`` loops, but not all.
#. Do not work for input validation.

``while`` Pros and Cons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. More flexible than ``for`` loops.
#. ANY ``for`` loop can be re-written as a ``while`` loop.
#. Do not need to know beforehand how many times the loop needs to run.
#. Can be used for input validation.
#. ``while`` loops require more work to build.
#. Making an infinite ``while`` loop is easy.

   You are asked to program a robot to move tennis balls from one box (Box #1)
   to another (Box #2), one-by-one. The robot should continue moving balls until
   Box #1 is empty. However, balls may be added to the box after the robot
   begins its work.
