Studio: Introduction To Data
============================

You will be working in a small group to discuss a potential data analysis project. Your course staff 
will give each group a scenario which outlines the business issue and what data you have at your 
disposal. Before you dive in, give everyone in your group time to read through the scenario and 
discuss it so that everyone is on the same page. Donâ€™t hesitate to ask course staff any questions you 
may have about your scenario! Use the Exercises as a guide for the discussion and make sure to leave 
yourselves time to put together a small presentation reviewing your discussion for the class.


In your presentation, make sure to include:

* The problem the business owner is trying to solve?

* Available data sources? What kind of information do we need?

* What would you need/do to prepare the data? Problems with the data?

* Talk about exploratory analysis and KPIs.

* Discuss what would make your results valid/invalid.

* Who are the stakeholders and how would you present your findings?
