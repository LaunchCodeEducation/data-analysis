===============================================================


Reading
-------

This chapter has been broken up into 2 main sections.  Part 1 will cover Dashboard Finesse while Part 2 will cover Tableau concepts involving calculations and parameters.  

Part 1:  Dashboard Finesse
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please watch the following videos (13:42 min total).

To complete this assignment, you are going to continue coding on the viz you worked on in ::ref:`Chapter 25<tableau-part1>`, using the World Bank CO2 dataset.

Watch the following videos above to help you learn about Tableau calculations functionality and  syntax, as well as  parameters.   The calculation videos are part of a larger calculations playlist.  We suggest you explore more videos in this playlist to learn more about calculations with certain data types and in specific situations.  Keep in mind that we will not be covering LOD (Level of Detail) calculations in this class,  so you may skip over those.

 

Remember, to watch any of the videos below, you must be logged into your Tableau.com account.

 

Each of these learning videos has a workbook that you can download to and code-along with.  You are not required to complete any of these workbooks, but it is suggested that you practice them to become more familiar with Tableau.

.. admonition:: Question

   Match the following calculation types to their definitions.

   .. list-table::
      :align: left
  
      * - Basic calculation
        - Computed values at the data source level as well as the visualization level with additional control over the granularity.
      * - Table Calculations
        - Allows transformation at both the data source and visualization level of detail, without any significant granularity.
      * - Level of Detail (LOD) Calculation
        - Allows transformation at the visualization level only.

.. admonition:: Question

   Which of the following is NOT one of the four basic components of a Tableau calculation?
  
   a. Functions
   #. Level of Detail 
   #. Fields 
   #. Operations 
 
.. admonition:: Question

   When would you use a calculation? (Select all that apply)
   
   a. Segment data
   #. Pivot a table
   #. Convert data type
   #. Aggregate data
   #. Drop a table
   #. No answer text provided. 

.. admonition:: Question

   A parameter can accept values that you specify.  This could include all, a list of possible values, or a range of values.  What determines the availability of these options?

   a. Basic Calculations 
   #. Table Calculations 
   #. Length of Data 
   #. Data Type 

  

.. admonition:: Question

   Match the definitions with their correct terms:

   .. list-table::
      :align: left
      
      * - Table Calculation 
        - Calculations that are part of the query and executed in the data source
      * - Basic or Regular Calculation
        - Local calculations that only occur in your Tableau workbook after any basic calculations have been completed

.. admonition:: Question

   Parameters must be incorporated into something else such as a filter, reference line or calculation field in order to be useful.  
  
   a. True 
   b. False
