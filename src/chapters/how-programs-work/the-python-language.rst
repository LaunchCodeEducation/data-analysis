The Python Language
===================

.. index:: Python

**Python** is one of many programming languages, each of which serves
different purposes. While not it's only function, Python is very widely used
by programmers for data analytic tasks. 

.. admonition:: Note

    `R <https://www.r-project.org/>`__ is another very popular language in the world of data analysis programming.

Many people suggest learning Python first out of the many programming languages available. 
Python can be extremely forgiving and is not strongly-typed, meaning that you do not have to specify the type of a variable when declaring and initializing it.
Python also comes with a number of modules and libraries we as data analysts can use to perform complex mathematical operations and visualize data.
