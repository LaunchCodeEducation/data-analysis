Please use your best judgement on the type of chart, layout, and interpretation of the list below. This is an exercise to get hands-on experience with Tableau. This will be the first stop on a journey of many skills!

#. We will be using the `Mushroom Classification <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification>`__ dataset from Kaggle.  Download the CSV file.
#. Open Tableau Public and connect to your dataset.  
#. Create visualizations for the following:  (a sheet for each).

   #. How many Mushrooms are poisonous vs edible?
   #. How many different habitats were mushrooms collected from?
   #. How many Mushroom habitats compared to class?
   #. How many Mushrooms sorted by class and cap-color?
   #. `Create aliases <https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/datafields_fieldproperties_aliases_ex1editing.htm>`__ for each letter in the chart from #4 above.
      
      a. Use the context provided in the dataset for what each letter represents.
      #. Explore the “Marks” card to add color or size to chart d based on the chart design you have chosen.
      #. Give your chart a new title.
      
   #. Create your own chart with at least 2 dimensions and aliases to provide context.
