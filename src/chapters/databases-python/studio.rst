Studio: Working with Databases in Python
========================================

Getting Started
---------------

Before getting started with the coding, create a ``watchlist`` of 10 TV shows/movies that you, personally, are interested in watching. 

For this weeks studio fork this `GitHub repository <https://github.com/launchcodeeducation/databases-and-py-studio>`__ and clone to your computer.  

If you need a refresher on how to do this see :ref:`Instruction for Using Github w/Jupyter Notebooks<usingGitHubNotebooks>`.

In Your Notebook
----------------

We will be using the `TV Shows dataset <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/tv-shows-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney>`__ from Kaggle. 
We have included the CSV for you in the repository you just cloned.

You will also be using the ``watchlist`` you created to figure out which streaming services contain the shows that you want to watch next so you can decide which one is worth the money to you.

As you complete the different tasks in the studio, you may choose between using ``pandas`` or SQL. 
Remember that during the prep work, we learned that one is oftentimes more efficient at certain tasks than the other, so choose wisely!

Submitting Your Work
--------------------

When finished make sure to push your changes up to GitHub. 
Copy the link to your GitHub repository and paste it into the submission box in Canvas for **Studio: Working with Databases in Python** and click *Submit*.
