Studio: SQL Part 1 - Introduction and Azure Data Studio
=======================================================

Getting Started
---------------

For this weeks studio fork this `GitHub repository <https://github.com/codinglikeagirl42/SQL-Part-1-Studio>`__ and 
clone to your computer.  If you need a refresher on how to do this see :ref:`Instruction for Using Github w/Jupyter Notebooks<usingGitHubNotebooks>`.

| In Azure Data Studio, click on the open button and navigate to where you saved the git repository you just cloned and open the notebook.  

| The focus of this studio is to get more familiar with SELECT statements and practice filtering the data.
 
* Break into small groups and work together to answer the questions.  
* Each member of the group should be coding along in their own notebooks.  
* The last studio question is for each person to create two questions and queries to answer their questions in their own notebook.  
* Each member of the group should have different questions and queries.
 
Present to the Class

| When the whole class comes back together, each person will present one of the questions they asked and the query used to solve it.
