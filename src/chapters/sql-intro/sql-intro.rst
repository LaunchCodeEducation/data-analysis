.. admonition:: Note

   As you read through the articles in the SQL lessons, you may find that you want to try out the queries the authors describe. 
   You have access to a database called ``AdventureWorks2019`` if you would like to try out some of these queries. 
   Doing so is additional practice separate from the exercises.


Read the following articles, follow along where instructed:

   a. As you read this article, skip the "Installation and Setup" section.
   #. Stop at the "Join" section.  
   #. The article uses SQLite3, while we are using T-SQL.  The biggest difference in sytax is that T-SQL uses ``TOP`` instead of ``LIMIT``.
