Studio: SQL Part 3 - Joins
==========================

Getting Started
---------------

For this weeks studio fork this `GitHub repository <https://github.com/codinglikeagirl42/SQL-Part-3-Studio>`__ and 
clone to your computer.  If you need a refresher on how to do this see :ref:`Instruction for Using Github w/Jupyter Notebooks<usingGitHubNotebooks>`.

| In Azure Data Studio, click on the open button and navigate to where you saved the git repository you just cloned and open the notebook.  

| The focus of this studio is to get more familiar with JOIN statements and to practice using them.
 
Use the last 30 minutes of studio time to regroup and each person will present one of the events they created and the query used to solve it.

* Break into small groups and work together to answer the questions.  
* Each member of the group should be coding along in their own notebooks.  
* In Part 2 of the studio, each person will pick their own month and create two events or promotions, creating queries to support their choices in their own notebook.
* Each member of the group should have different questions and queries.
