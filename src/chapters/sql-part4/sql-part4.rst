.. admonition:: Question

   Every statement that uses a subquery can be re-written as a ``JOIN``. 

   a. True
   b. False

.. admonition:: Question

   A subquery cannot use ``ORDER BY``, but the main query can.

   a. True
   b. False

.. admonition:: Question

   Match the operator to the result set:

   .. list-table::
      :align: left
  
      * - ``INTERSECT``
        - Combined rows from both queries.
      * - ``EXCEPT``
        - Only keeps rows in common with both queries.
      * - ``UNION``
        - Keeps rows from left query that aren't in common with right query.

.. admonition:: Question

   ``UNION`` combines columns and ``JOINS`` combine rows.

   a. True
   b. False

.. admonition:: Question

   What is the difference between a correlated subquery and a nested subquery?
