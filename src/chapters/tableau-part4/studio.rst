Studio: Tableau Part 4 - Stories and Dates
==========================================

Getting Started
---------------

| This is a group studio.  Your group has been asked to create a visual for the International Fencing Federation (FIE).   Work through the data analysis steps that you have been learning in this program to create your final viz. 

| As a group, explore your data and decide upon: 

1. A business issue or a question you want to explore further.  
#. Next clean, and manipulate the data to create vizzes that provide insight to your business issue or question.  
#. Your final output should be a dashboard that best provides insight on your discoveries.  
#. You will present your dashboard at the end of class.
#. Suggested Topics to Explore:

   #. Weapons
   #. Handedness
   #. Category
   #. Ages
   #. Location and/or Time Zone
   #. What factors predict wins? 
   
| You are not limited to these topics.  If you discover something more interesting, explore away!  

Setting Up the Studio:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Open the csv file in Tableau Public.  
#. When you open this data set, you may want to create a relationship between the csv files.

   #. You will explore this in the EDA section below.

#. Here is more information about the `International Fencing Federation <https://fie.org/>`__.



EDA
^^^

1. The dataset contains 4 CSVs. You only need to work with the ones that will provide answers to your questions.

#. Explore the tables and play with the columns you think you might use. 

   #. When you get a viz that you like, ask yourself the following questions:

      A. Why do you like it?  What is it showing?
      #. Would it work better with a calculation or any manipulation?
      #. Would looking at a smaller sample, like the top 100, help?

Cleaning
^^^^^^^^

#. Do you need to clean any of the data you have decided to work with?

   #. Any nulls?  

      A. Are they appropriate for the data?

   #. Any discrepancies?

      A. Hint: ages might need some attention.

Manipulation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Do you need to use any calculations to answer the questions?
#. Thinking of your dashboard, how do you think you would like to present your data to your audience? 
#. In order to do this, do you need:

   #. Filters? 
   #. Groups? 
   #. Parameters? 
   #. Calculations?

Dashboard and Finesse
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Create a final dashboard viz that answers the question(s)/topic(s) you explored.
2. Now is a good time to update labels and colors for an easily digestible report.
3. Hide your worksheets

Finishing Touches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| Before you turn in your vizzes:

#. Make sure that they are easy to read. 
#. Review and edit any axes so that they don't contain any file information. 
#. Make sure any filtering, group, or set information is easy to understand. 
#. If you want to explore fonts and colors, go right ahead. 

Present Your Dashboard to the class and provide feedback to your classmates.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Share even if your group dashboard is not complete, we want to see your unique ideas.
