Studio: Data Manipulation
=========================

Getting Started
---------------

For the studio, we will be continuing to work with pumpkins!  Each of you should fork this `GitHub repository <https://github.com/launchcodeeducation/data-manipulation/>`__ and 
clone to your computer.  If you need a refresher on how to do this see :ref:`Instruction for Using GitHub w/Jupyter Notebooks<usingGitHubNotebooks>`.

* As always confer with a partner if you want to talk something through! 
* You are more than welcome to also pull up your notebook from the last lesson to help you speed 
  through cleaning the data and get straight to manipulating it.
  
Submitting Your Work
--------------------

When finished make sure to push your changes up to GitHub. Copy the link to your GitHub 
repository and paste it into the submission box in Canvas for **Studio: Data Manipulation** 
and click *Submit*.
