Exercises: Introduction to Statistics and Data Modeling
=======================================================

Getting Started
---------------

Fork this `GitHub repository <https://github.com/codinglikeagirl42/IntroToStats>`__ and 
clone to your computer.  If you need a refresher on how to do this 
see :ref:`Instruction for Using Github w/Jupyter Notebooks<usingGitHubNotebooks>`.

Follow along with `this article <https://www.learndatasci.com/tutorials/data-science-statistics-using-python/>`__, in the notebook you just opened.  We suggest that instead of copy and pasting the code, you type it out.  This will help you become more familiar with the syntax and better understand it.

Submitting Your Work
--------------------

When finished make sure to push your changes up to GitHub. Copy the link to your GitHub 
repository and paste it into the submission box in Canvas for **Exercises: Data Modeling Part 1** 
and click *Submit*.
