Exercises: Modules
==================

Idea: create new python program from scratch, similar to Hello Messages in Java. 
The program starts with index.py, two or three variables
create new file that will be imported into index
new file to contain 2-3 methods
practice importing whole module into index
import one var from module into index
create new file with at least one variable
import that new file into index as a renamed item, import a single item renamed
create a package (aka a slightly dfferent program)
bring package into index
use dir() to see available vars
run package separately from index

Create ex solns and add ~half to solutions appendix
No Studio (lesson is coupled with GIT, a long studio)
