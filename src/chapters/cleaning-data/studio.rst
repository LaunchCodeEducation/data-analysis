Studio: Cleaning Data 
=====================

Getting Started
---------------

For this weeks studio you will be working with a partner.  Each of you should fork this `GitHub repository <https://github.com/speudusa/DataCleaning-Pumpkin-Sales>`__ and 
clone to your computer.  If you need a refresher on how to do this see :ref:`Instruction for Using GitHub w/Jupyter Notebooks<usingGitHubNotebooks>`.

| The notebook poses questions for partners to discuss and answer about data cleaning.

* Code has been provided so that discussion can be the primary focus of the studio
* Spaces for notes and answers to questions provided in the notebook

| Objective: practice giving a voice to your rationale behind cleaning data.

* No right answer.  This is very open ended with the intention for asking questions about why more than how.

Submitting Your Work
--------------------

When finished make sure to push your changes up to GitHub. Copy the link to your GitHub 
repository and paste it into the submission box in Canvas for Studio: Cleaning Data 
and click *Submit*.
