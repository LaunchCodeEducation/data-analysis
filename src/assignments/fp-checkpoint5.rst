Checkpoint 5: Modeling Data 
===========================

Before You Start
----------------

While working on this checkpoint, you will also have to present your work on the previous four 
checkpoints. We included notes on final project presentations at the end of this assignment. 
If you want to change anything about what you have done so far in earlier checkpoints, you do not 
have to re-submit any previous checkpoints unless your mentor requests you do so.

Getting Started
---------------

Fork `this GitHub repository <https://github.com/gildedgardenia/checkpoint-five>`__ and clone it to your 
computer. Follow the instructions within the notebook to create a linear regression model with your cleaned 
dataset. If it doesn't work out very well, that is alright. The most important thing is that you train a 
model and summarize the results.

**Examples**

Checkpoint 5 examples can be found `here <https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/finalProjectDAExamples/tree/main/Checkpoint%205>`__.

Submitting Your Work
--------------------

When finished with your linear regression model, make sure to push your changes up to Github. Copy the link to 
your Github repository and paste it into the submission box in Canvas for Graded Assignment #4: Checkpoint 
5 and click *Submit*.
