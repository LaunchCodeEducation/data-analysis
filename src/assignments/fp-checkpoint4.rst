Checkpoint 4: Tableau Story
===========================

Before You Start
----------------

You want to first check to see if you have received any feedback from Checkpoints 2 and 3. This 
feedback could influence the direction of your work on Checkpoint 4. If you want to change anything 
about what you have done so far in earlier checkpoints, you do not have to re-submit any previous 
checkpoints unless your mentor requests you do so. You can simply add any updated work and notes to 
the current checkpoint.

Getting Started
---------------

For this checkpoint, you will need to manipulate your data and produce a Tableau story that shows off 
skills from class, such as filtering and table calculations. You may find yourself wanting to use 
Pandas and Jupyter notebooks for data manipulation. If you do, make sure to add code comments 
explaining your thought process and push your work up to Github. No matter what visualizations you 
add to your Tableau story, all of your captions should include explanations as to your thought 
process for each visualization. The first caption should include a link to your dataset and the 
final story point should include links to any supporting materials, such as the Github repository 
if you used a Jupyter notebook for this checkpoint. 

**Examples** 

Checkpoint 4 examples can be found `here <https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/finalProjectDAExamples/tree/main/Checkpoint%204>`__.

Submitting Your Work
--------------------

When finished paste the link to your Tableau story into the submission box in Canvas for Graded 
Assignment #4: Checkpoint 4 and click *Submit*.
