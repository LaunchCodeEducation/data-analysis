Checkpoint 3: Cleaning Data
===========================


Before You Start
----------------

You may find it easier to work on Checkpoint Three and Checkpoint Two in tandem. We encourage you to do 
whatever is easiest for you, but you should be making sure that you keep the appropriate work in each 
notebook. If you put a cleaning step in your EDA notebook, you may not receive a full grade for this 
checkpoint. If you want to change anything about what you have done so far in earlier checkpoints, you do 
not have to re-submit any previous checkpoints unless your mentor requests you do so.

Getting Started
---------------

Fork `this GitHub repository <https://github.com/launchcodeeducation/cleaning-data-checkpoint>`__ and 
clone it to your computer. Follow the instructions within the notebook using your chosen dataset. 
Add notes about your process where directed to. 

After you have cleaned your data, you will want to export your clean dataset from your notebook. 
The following `article <https://medium.com/@kasiarachuta/importing-and-exporting-csv-files-in-python-7fa6e4d9f408>`__ 
will provide you with the syntax for this step. The rest of the checkpoints should be completed 
using your cleaned data.

**Examples**

Checkpoint 3 examples can be found `here <https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/finalProjectDAExamples/tree/main/Checkpoint%203>`__.

Submitting Your Work
--------------------

When finished cleaning your data, make sure to push your changes up to GitHub including your 
new cleaned dataset. Copy the link to your GitHub repository and paste it into the submission box 
in Canvas for Graded Assignment #4: Checkpoint 3 and click *Submit*.
