Checkpoint 1: Choose your Data
==============================

For this assignment, you must search for a dataset you want to get to know very well. So 
far in this class, your data has been assigned to you. Here, you have the opportunity to 
discover all of the free and readily available data out in the world for public consumption. 

You have creative liberty with two decisions here. One is the data you wanted to use, the 
other is the business issue you want to ask. Perhaps you have a burning question about 
climate change, local home prices, or average daily screen usage. The scale of your 
question can be as macro or as micro as you wish. 

For inspiration, think about what brought you to this class in the first place. Is it to 
get a new job? Maybe you'll look for more Bureau of Labor datasets or ask a different 
question of the Assignment 3 (9 to 5) data. Maybe you'll want to dive into some data for 
a field you're interested in joining. Healthcare, finance, advertising, manufacturing, 
logistics, mapping, are just a few fields with growing need for analysts. You could also 
just have a hobby that you want to learn more about, such as knitting or running. Choose 
what fuels your interest. This can be an expansion or alternative analysis of a dataset 
we've used in class so far.

For some, your inspiration may come instead from doing a little data surfing. We've found most 
of the exercise and studio datasets from `Kaggle <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets>`__. 
`Tableau <https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/resources?qt-overview_resources=1#qt-overview_resources>`__ 
lists some solid choices as well. You are not limited to just these resources for sourcing 
your data. If you are interested in looking at regional data, there are resources like the 
`STL Regional Data Exchange <https://rdx.stldata.org/search/type/dataset>`__, 
`OpenDataPhilly <https://www.opendataphilly.org/organization/city-of-philadelphia>`__, and 
`OpenDataKC <https://data.kcmo.org/>`__ to check out.

Here's what you should consider when sourcing your data:

* Is it in a format you know how to work with? 
* Is it licensed for your educational use?
* Does it require a request process and will that prevent you from turning in your checkpoints on time?
* If you do find a cool set of data that requires a lengthy request process, talk to your mentors. They may know about alternatives you can use.

Kaggle Tips
-----------

**Usability**

Kaggle shows a usability score for datasets. Keep this figure in mind when searching for data. 
Usability score takes into account such factors as how dirty the data is, how much context is 
given, and what information is present in the columns. Hover over a usability score to see the 
criteria. Do not select a dataset with a usability score under 7.

**Size**

Keep in mind that larger datasets will not load in Tableau. Check the size of the dataset you 
are interested in and make sure it is well below 50 MB.  If you are struggling with finding a 
dataset that fits the size limit, check the sizes of the files within the dataset to see if 
you could use one or two CSVs instead of the whole thing.

**Licensing**

You can find the licensing information for each dataset on the main dataset page. Click on 
the license type to read more about what you can and can not do with the dataset. Some 
authors may choose a license type that requires you to credit the source of the dataset on 
your work. The license type you should be looking for is CC0: Public Domain. This means that 
the dataset is not copyrighted and you may do with it what you will. However, you may not in 
any way imply that your work is endorsed by the author. For example, if your dataset is put 
together by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, you may not claim that the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics believes your work to be the most accurate representation of the workforce. 

**Tags**

If you are interested in a specific topic or type of analysis (i.e. regression), you can 
search for tags. This can help narrow down the options. For example, if you want to search 
for some data about education and the UN, you might use “United Nations” as a search term 
and specify that datasets should be tagged with the “education” tag. 

**Additional Notes**

Keep an eye out for non-Latin characters, such as Russian. During the visualization lesson, 
you may remember the Goodreads dataset had some errors that you were able to work around. 
Those errors were due to the Pandas not being able to process non-Latin characters properly. 
If you encounter this, you may have to clean out those rows causing trouble, leading to 
inaccuracies in your analysis. 

Submitting Your Work
--------------------

Before you submit your work, download the dataset to ensure that it will meet your needs. 
If your computer cannot download the dataset due to its size, try a similar dataset that 
is smaller or download the individual files. Open up the file(s) using the default 
application for your computer to see that there are in fact numbers in there and to see 
how many rows are in the file so that you don't run into an issue with Tableau later. 
Tableau Public works best when the dataset is below 10 million rows.

When you are confident in your choice, create a new document on your computer using your 
word-processing program. Put your name in the right-hand corner and type up your business 
issue and provide the link to your chosen dataset. Submit your document on the Canvas 
submission page for Graded Assignment #4: Checkpoint 1.
