Instruction for Using Github w/Jupyter Notebooks
================================================

Welcome to Git!
---------------

Git is the most common version control system used in the tech industry 
today. After Assignment 1(submitted in Replit), you will submit your 
exercises, studios and assignments using Github.

This will help your mentors access your code more easily and will help 
you practice a valuable industry skill.

Set up your own Github account `here <https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home>`__.
or if you already have an account `sign in here <https://github.com/login?return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsignup%3Fref_cta%3DSign%2Bup%26ref_loc%3Dheader%2Blogged%2Bout%26ref_page%3D%252F%26source%3Dheader-home>`__.

When you click a link to the git notebooks in the instructions, it will 
take you to the repository page and will look something like this.
