Setting Up Python
=================

Configuring Python on your computer is something that we will do over multiple stages at this class. 
As you progress from printing out strings to running complex calculations, you will have to install new tools and configure different environments.
If an installed tool is not working out, this page is here for you to refer back to as something may depend on a different tool that you installed on this page.

Installing Python
-----------------

The first thing you need to code in Python is Python itself!

To install Python, use the links on `Python's website <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__ to download Python. Make sure that you are downloading the appropriate version for your operating system.
At the time of writing, the latest version of Python avaialble for download is 3.9.

.. admonition:: Note

   If you are a Mac user, you already have a version of Python on your machine. This is likely Python 2.
   We will be using Python 3 throughout the class, but Mac users may find Python 2 popping up when using commands as it is the machine's default.
