Setup and Introduction to Tableau
=================================

Creating Your Tableau Public and Tableau Accounts:
--------------------------------------------------

We will be working with `Tableau Public <https://public.tableau.com/app/discover>`__.

#. `Download the app <https://www.tableau.com/products/public/download>`__.
#. `Create a Tableau Public account <https://public.tableau.com/app/discover?authMode=signUp>`__.

We will also be using documentation provided by `Tableau <https://www.tableau.com/>`__.  

#. You will need to make a separate account `here <https://id.tableau.com/register?clientId=d22771tvaQXmFdNduz4sh5pvlWu0HDbF>`__ as well.  This will allow you to access additional materials, like videos, contained within the reading assignments. 
#. For additional video resources check out the videos `here <https://www.tableau.com/learn/training/20211>`__.
   * These videos are for version 2021.1.  
   * You can select the version you would like to view at the bottom of the collection list.

.. admonition:: Note
   
   You should have two accounts one for Tableau Public and one for Tableau.
   
Watch the following videos and complete the assigned Tasks:

.. admonition:: Note

   As you watch the videos you may notice a discrepancy between your interface and one in the video.  
   You are still able to code along with each video, you might have to look in a different location than 
   shown in the video. 

   You will need to save and publish your final charts in videos 1 and 6.  In order to complete the final 
   worksheet in video 6, you will need to work through videos 4-6 in the same Tableau Public Visualization.
