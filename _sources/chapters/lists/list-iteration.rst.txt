Iterating Through Lists
=======================

We can use a loop to iterate through the elements in a list in the same way we did with the characters in a string.

Loop by Element
---------------

Since a list is simply a sequence of separate data values, Python gives us a
way to automatically iterate over those elements.

.. admonition:: Example

   .. sourcecode:: Python
      :linenos:

      shopping_list_items = ['apples', 'oranges', 'bananas', 'bread', 'toothpaste']

      print('You need to buy:')
      for item in shopping_list_items:     # Iterate by element
         print('\t' + item)           # Print a tab followed by the string assigned to 'item'
      
   **Console Output**

   ::

      You need to buy:
         apples
         oranges
         bananas
         bread
         toothpaste

The syntax almost reads like natural language: *For each item in
shopping_list_items, print a tab character plus the item*.

Each time the loop repeats, Python assigns the next element in the list to the
variable ``item``. The elements may be of any data type.

.. admonition:: Tip

   To keep the meaning of your code clear, use plural names for your
   lists---like ``fruits``, ``cars``, ``even_numbers``, etc.

   When you iterate through a list, use the singular name for the loop
   variable.

   #. ``for fruit in fruits:``
   #. ``for car in cars:``
   #. ``for even_number in even_numbers:``

   This helps you explain what your code is doing. For example, in step 2, you
   can think to yourself, *Each time the loop repeats, my code takes one
   car element from the cars list*.

Loop by Index
-------------

We can also use the ``range`` command to generate index values, and then use
bracket notation to access each element from the list:

.. admonition:: Example

   .. sourcecode:: Python
      :linenos:

      shopping_list_items = ['apples', 'oranges', 'bananas', 'bread', 'toothpaste']

      for index in range(len(shopping_list_items)):     # Iterate by index
         print("{0}) {1}".format(index+1, shopping_list_items[index]))
      
   **Console Output**

   ::

      1) apples
      2) oranges
      3) bananas
      4) bread
      5) toothpaste

Note the following:

#. In this loop, ``range(len(shopping_list_items))`` generates a sequence of
   integers up to but not including the length of the list. Since
   ``len(shopping_list_items)`` returns the value ``5``, this list of integers
   will be ``0, 1, 2, 3, 4``.
#. Each time the loop repeats, Python assigns the next integer in the
   sequence to the variable ``index``.
#. In line 4, note how we use the ``index`` values to calculate the item
   numbers and access each element from the list.

   a. The ``{0}`` placeholder gets filled with the value of ``index`` plus
      one. Since ``index`` takes the values 0 - 4, the output shows the
      line numbers 1 - 5.
   b. The ``{1}`` placeholder gets filled with one element from the list.
      When ``index`` is ``0``, ``shopping_list_items[index]`` returns
      ``'apples'``. The next time the loop repeats, ``index`` is ``1``, and
      ``shopping_list_items[index]`` returns ``'oranges'``.

Which Syntax Should We Use?
---------------------------

Should we *loop by element* or *loop by index*? In many cases, the choice comes
down to personal preference. Sometimes, however, one option will be better than
the other.

.. admonition:: Example

   Given ``scores = [10, 25, 8, 33, 0]``, the code shows two ways to add up all
   of the values from the list:

   .. sourcecode:: Python
      :linenos:

      for score in scores:             # Option 1: Loop by element
         total_points += score
      
      for index in range(len(scores)): # Option 2: Loop by index
         total_points += scores[index]

The end result is the same for both loops, ``total_points`` winds up with a
value of ``76``. However, the syntax for looping by element (option 1) is
cleaner, since we do not have to worry about bracket notation.

This example shows doing something WITH the list elements. We access each one
in turn and add it to ``total_points``. We do NOT change any of the elements
themselves. ``print(scores)`` returns ``[10, 25, 8, 33, 0]`` even after the
loop finishes.

The next example shows a case where we change the values of some list elements:

.. admonition:: Example

   Given ``scores = [10, 25, 8, 33, 0]``, the code below changes the points for
   some of the values:

   .. sourcecode:: Python
      :linenos:
      
      print(scores)

      for index in range(len(scores)):    # Loop by index
         if index >= 2:                   # Check position in list
            scores[index] += 12           # If True, increase the value of the element

      print(scores)

   **Console Output**

   ::

      [10, 25, 8, 33, 0]
      [10, 25, 20, 45, 12]
   
   Take a moment to think about what happens inside this loop. We change the
   value of an element based on its *position* in the list. 
   
   #. Each time the loop runs, ``index`` gets assigned the next value in the
      sequence ``0, 1, 2, 3, 4``.
   #. Line 4 checks if the element in the list is at index 2 or later. If
      ``True``, we add 12 points to the value.
   #. We use the bracket notation in line 5 to change the value of the selected
      element.

We can also change list elements based on their values instead of their
locations:

.. admonition:: Example

   .. sourcecode:: Python
      :linenos:
      
      print(scores)

      for index in range(len(scores)):    # Loop by index
         if scores[index]%2 == 0:         # Check if the current score is even
            scores[index] *= 2            # If True, double the score

      print(scores)

   **Console Output**

   ::

      [10, 25, 8, 33, 0]
      [20, 25, 16, 33, 0]
   
   #. Line 4 checks if the value for the current list element is even.
   #. If ``True``, line 5 doubles the value and reassigns it to the same
      index location in the list.

Since lists are mutable, we can use a loop to change some or all of the
elements. To do this, we must know the *position* of the element in the list,
and this requires an index value.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. If we need to access the values inside a list without changing the list
   itself, then looping by element is the cleaner approach.
#. Looping by element avoids *index out of range* errors.
#. If we need to change one or more of the values in a list, then we MUST loop
   by index.
#. If we need to access elements based on their position, then looping by index
   is the better choice.
