`What is SQL? <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27axs9dO7AE>`__

`What Is a Database? <https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-database/>`__

`Learn to write SQL queries in 5 minutes! <https://medium.com/geekculture/writing-your-first-sql-query-610da7a5afea>`__

`Learn to write basic SQL Queries. <https://www.sqlshack.com/learn-to-write-basic-sql-queries/>`__

Read the following article, skipping the installation and set up section and stopping at the Join section.  We are just looking for comprehension to help guide when completing the exercises.  As they are using SQLite, some of the terminology may be slightly different.  We are using T-SQL which uses TOP instead of LIMIT.

.. admonition:: note

   As you read through the articles in the SQL lessons, you may find that you want to try out the queries the authors describe. You have access to a database called AdventureWorks2019 if you would like to try out some of these queries. Doing so is additional practice separate from the exercises.
